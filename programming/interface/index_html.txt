Index.html
==========

When user opens a Jam.py application in a Web browser, the browser first loads
the *index.html* file. This file is located in the root directory of a project
and accessed/modified by click on ``index.html [F10]`` on :doc:`Task </admin/task>`  tree.

The html file contains links to **css** and **js** files, that 
client application is using. The files that start with **jam** are located in 
the *jam* folder of the Jam.py package directory on the server. 

For example 

.. code-block:: html

    <link href="jam/css/jam.css" rel="stylesheet">

If needed, other files can be added here. For example some charting library. 
It is better to place them in the *js* and *css* folders of the *static* 
directory of the project.

For example 

.. code-block:: html

    <script src="static/js/Chart.min.js"></script>

For forms templates, please see 
:doc:`Forms <forms>` 
and
:doc:`Form templates <form_templates>` for details.

At the end of the file there is a following script:

.. code-block:: html

    <script>
    $(document).ready(function(){
        task.load()
      });
    </script>
    
In this script the 
:doc:`load </refs/client/task/m_load>`
method of the task, that has been created when *jam.js* file was loaded, is 
called that loads information about the
:doc:`task tree </programming/task_tree>` 
from the server and, based on this information, builds its tree, loads modules,
assigns event handlers to its items and triggers
:doc:`on_page_loaded </refs/client/task/on_page_loaded>`
event. See 
:doc:`Initializing application <initializing_application>`
